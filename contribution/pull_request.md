####Tips for Creating the Perfect Pull Request
*The following is excerpted from Keavy's article on the Github blog, ["How to write the perfect pull request"](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request)*:
- Include the purpose of this Pull Request. For example: This is a spike to explore… This simplifies the display of… This fixes handling of…

* Consider providing an overview of why the work is taking place (with any relevant links); don’t assume familiarity with the history.

- Remember that anyone in the company could be reading this Pull Request, so the content and tone may inform people other than those taking part, now or later.

- Be explicit about what feedback you want, for example: a quick pair of eyes on the code, discussion on the technical approach or critique on design.

- Be explicit about when you want feedback, if the Pull Request is work in progress, say so. A prefix of “[WIP]” in the title is a simple, common pattern to indicate that state.

- @mention individuals that you specifically want to involve in the discussion, and mention why. (“/cc @jesseplusplus for clarification on this logic”).

- @mention teams that you want to involve in the discussion, and mention why. (“/cc @github/security, any concerns with this approach?”)
