# Collections

## MongoDB Collections

We define all new collections we've created in `lib/collections.js`.

```text
Learnings = new Mongo.Collection("learnings");
Hangouts = new Mongo.Collection("hangouts");
Notifications = new Mongo.Collection('notifications');
RSVPnotifications = new Mongo.Collection("rsvp-notifications");
Comments = new Mongo.Collection('comments');
ArchivedUsers = new Mongo.Collection("archived-users");
Migrations = new Mongo.Collection("migrations");
```

## Users

The `users` collection is implicitly given to us by Meteor. Here's an example user:
