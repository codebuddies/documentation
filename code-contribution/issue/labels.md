# Issue Labels

When labeling issues, we have tried to opt for clarity over brevity.

## Label Prefixes

The majority of issue labels are given a prefix to help with categorisation. The exceptions are labels that carry meaning across organisations and projects, e.g "good-first-issue" and "help-wanted".

* `[type]`
* `[state]`
* `[priority]`
* `[feature]`
* `[tech]`

## Label Definitions
