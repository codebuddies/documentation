# 2/ Finding an Issue

## 1. Find an issue that interests you!

Look at some of the [open issues](https://github.com/codebuddies/cb-v2-scratch/issues) and identify one that sparks your interest.

* If you are looking for issues that are good for beginners, check out the issues labeled ["good-for-beginners"](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-for-beginners) or ["good first issue"](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue")

For an explanation of issue lables see: [Issue Labels](https://github.com/codebuddies/documentation/tree/39c5f5c8c60a9a0f2466e02a6d7a0bd7d42734b1/contribution/contribution/labels.md).

## 2. Claim that issue!

If you want to work on the issue, leave a comment on it saying that you're working on it.

## 3. Create a new branch!

Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b issue-x`, where x is the number associated with that number. For example, if you decided to work on [issue \#491](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/issues/491), you would type `git checkout -b issue-491` and create a branch named `issue-491`.
