## Tips for Creating the Perfect Pull Request

_The following is excerpted from Keavy's article on the Github blog,_ [_"How to write the perfect pull request"_](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request):

* Include the purpose of this Pull Request. For example: This is a spike to explore… This simplifies the display of… This fixes handling of…
* Consider providing an overview of why the work is taking place \(with any relevant links\); don’t assume familiarity with the history.
* Remember that anyone in the company could be reading this Pull Request, so the content and tone may inform people other than those taking part, now or later.
* Be explicit about what feedback you want, for example: a quick pair of eyes on the code, discussion on the technical approach or critique on design.
* Be explicit about when you want feedback, if the Pull Request is work in progress, say so. A prefix of “\[WIP\]” in the title is a simple, common pattern to indicate that state.
* @mention individuals that you specifically want to involve in the discussion, and mention why. \(“/cc @jesseplusplus for clarification on this logic”\).
* @mention teams that you want to involve in the discussion, and mention why. \(“/cc @github/security, any concerns with this approach?”\)
